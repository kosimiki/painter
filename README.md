PainterApp
===================
This application is a homework project of Kosárkár Miklós.
The app is capable of creating paint objects with parameters like brand, color, coverage and store them in an .xml file which can be loaded thus maintaining persistence.
You can also create simple surfaces objects which you want to paint such as a wall or which you want to leave out like doors or windows.
The main functionality of the application is that it can calculate the required litre paint and how much it will cost.

> **Note:**
> - This project requires 1.8 java. It contains lambda expressions and JavaFX.
